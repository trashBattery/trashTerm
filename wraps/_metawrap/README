This is an example wrap structure. 

unWrapp utility will read wraps and expect the following formatting. 

wrap parent directory - Name of the wrap is the directory name. conflicts will be dealt with via versioning suffixes
    EXAMPLE: wimdy, wimdy_b1.0.2, wimdy_bifrostEidition
    - unWrapp can rename wraps and will rename the core lua as well to match.
core lua - This will share the same name as the parent directory. Must match. 
README - standard readme. plaintext. Can say anything. Must be named README
metasrc - resource folder for wrap-specific resources.
    - Shared resources will use trashTerm/piles. piles are regulated by the trashTerm version and are used to save space.
